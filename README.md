# Consumer Grievance Classification Model

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to classifying customer complaints using machine learning techniques. The primary language is Jupyter Notebook, making it interactive and suitable for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Features

- End-to-end workflow for customer complaint classification.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning steps.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights into complaint data.
- Text vectorization and feature engineering.
- Implementation of various machine learning models for classification.
- Model evaluation and comparison.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kvmeena12/Customer_complaints_Classifications.git
   cd Customer_complaints_Classifications
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files.
   - Install required Python packages (commonly used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, etc.).
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
     ```

3. **Run the Notebooks**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the relevant notebook files and execute the cells in order.
